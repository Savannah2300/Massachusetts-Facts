  <h1>Everything you need to know about Massachusetts!</h1>
  <h2>Geography</h2>
  <p>Massachusetts is a New England state bordered by New Hampshire and Vermont in the north, the Atlantic Ocean in the east, Rhode Island and Connecticut in the south, and New York in the west. It is the seventh smallest of the U.S. states in terms of total area. 
What looks like a big hook in Massachusetts’ eastern coastline is actually land created by glaciers that exposed many rocky bays. Called the Coastal Lowland, this hilly, wet area includes Cape Cod Bay, Martha’s Vineyard, and the Nantucket Islands, all great for fishing, boating, and vacationing. The land is veined with rivers—19 main systems, the most notable of which are the Connecticut, Charles, and Merrimack. 
The center of the state has streams and plains with gentle hills. Toward the west, the land rises into mountains. It includes a popular spot for fall-leaf watching called the Berkshires, as well as Massachusetts’ highest point, Mount Greylock. In the far west are the Taconic Mountains. </p>

<h2>General and History</h2>
<p>Massachusetts is unique among states because its history and culture predate and epitomize the experiences of the country as a whole. It was colonized in the 17th century. The beginning phase of this colonization was very difficult for the colonists and they suffered many hardships such as disease epidemics, starvation, war, political struggles and a massive witch hunt brought on by mass hysteria. Although the New England colonies began as separate, privately-run colonies, by the end of the century the British government took them over and turned them into one large royal colony heavily regulated and ruled by the crown. It is commonly known that the Puritans and Pilgrims set the stage for eventual liberty of religious belief when they fled an oppressive government to settle in the New World. With such documents as the Mayflower Compact (1620) and the Body of Liberties (1641), an early code of law, they provided the basis for the concept that governments should rule by consent of the governed and with guarantees to protect individual expression. </p>

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<p>Massachusetts’ name might come from the Massachusett tribe, whose name can be translated to “near the great hill” or “near the range of hills.” It refers to the Blue Hills, southwest of Boston. Boston cream pie—chocolate-iced white cake filled with custard—is the official state dessert. But it’s not the only famous Massachusetts goodie: Chocolate chip cookies were invented here!
In 2004 Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage; the law pointed out that excluding certain citizens from a valued institution was incompatible with the principles of individual autonomy and legal equality. 
Paul Revere, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Dr. Seuss (whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel) were all born in Massachusetts.
In the late 1600s about 20 people died because they were accused of witchcraft in a series of hearings called the Salem witch trials.
You can visit Plymouth Rock, the boulder that’s said to be the exact spot where the Pilgrims stepped off the Mayflower. It’s less than half the size today as it was in the 1600s — tourists kept chipping off pieces!
